Gloves of Missile Snaring
Foik Morur demonstrated the effectiveness of these gloves at a community fair near Beregost several years back. He paid a local Archer to fire arrows at him. As the arrows approached, Foik's hands would move of their own accord, either knocking the arrow away or catching it. He earned more than a few pieces of gold for his troubles, and these earnings attracted some shadowy figures to Foik's tent that evening. The next morning, Foik was found dead and the gloves missing.

The No-Dachi sword is a derivative of the Katana. Karaturan Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the Katana, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of No-Dachi swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanced by masterworking the item.
