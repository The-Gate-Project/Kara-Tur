Gloves of Missile Snaring
Foik Morur demonstrated the effectiveness of these gloves at a community fair near Beregost several years back. He paid a local Archer to fire arrows at him. As the arrows approached, Foik's hands would move of their own accord, either knocking the arrow away or catching it. He earned more than a few pieces of gold for his troubles, and these earnings attracted some shadowy figures to Foik's tent that evening. The next morning, Foik was found dead and the gloves missing.

The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process that is more art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Turan culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process that is more art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Turan culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath.

The wakizashi, or companion sword, is extremely important to samurai. It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night.

The sword of the ninja, the ninjato, is of lower quality than other Kara-Turan blades such as the katana. The ninjato is short with a straight blade, making it ideal for subterfuge. The ninjato is also more suited to fighting in closed places, sometimes giving the ninja an advantage over the longer blades that the samurai use.

The No-Dachi sword is a derivative of the Katana. Karaturan Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the Katana, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of No-Dachi swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanced by masterworking the item.
